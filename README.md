# Coq heterogeneous lists

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-hlist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tchajed/coq-hlist)

Basic library for heterogeneous lists.

Heterogeneous lists are quite tricky to implement and use correctly; this library will not aim to be complete for sophisticated use cases.
